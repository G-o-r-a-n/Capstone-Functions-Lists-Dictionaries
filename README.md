# Capstone - Functions, Lists and Dictionaries

This Python command-line application, "To-Do List Manager", is currently under development. When complete, it will allow users to efficiently manage their to-do lists.

## Objective:

Upon completion, the objectives of this project will be to:

- Provide a user-friendly command-line interface for managing tasks.
- Enable users to perform the following operations:
    - Add new tasks to the to-do list.
    - Mark existing tasks as complete.
    - Delete tasks from the to-do list.

## Code Explained (Under Development):

The final version of the script is expected to execute the following steps:

1. Present User Interface: The script will start by presenting a user-friendly command-line interface where users can manage their to-do tasks.
1. Handle User Input: The script will then handle user input to perform the desired operations (adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks).

## Usage (To Be Updated):

Upon completion, users will be able to run this script from their terminal, interact with the user-friendly interface, and manage their to-do list tasks efficiently.

```
python to_do_list_manager.py
```

### Note:

This script, when completed, will be a part of a capstone project series aimed at developing proficiency in Python. Please note that the current version of the script is still under development. Further updates will be posted as progress is made on the script's functionality.
